The project was created using the Apple’s PreLoginAgentCocoa Xcode project: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/PreLoginAgents/PreLoginAgents.zip

Project root:
Renamed project from “PreLoginAgentCocoa” to “SetSystemClockAtLoginWindow”
Set the Bundle Identifier

main.xib:
Set the panel title to “Date & Time”
Under the Size Inspector set the Initial Position to centre horizontally and vertically.
Added an Image View, set Image to NSCaution and Scaling to Proportionally Up or Down
main.xib: Added a Wrapping Label with message “Oops! The battery went flat, causing the date & time to reset. You must enter the correct date & time before logging in.”
Added a Date Picker with Hour and Minute elements
Added a “Today's date & time:” label
Replaced the “Quit” button with a “Save & Restart” push button
Repositioned and resized the window to be aesthetically pleasing

main.xib & AppDelegate.h
Created a new IBOutlet named “textualDatePicker”
Created a new IBAction named “applyButton”

AppDelegate.m
Replace the applyButton IBAction function with the following code:
- (void)awakeFromNib
{
// Set date & time field to current system time
[textualDatePicker setDateValue:[NSDate date]];
}

- (IBAction)applyButton:(id)sender
{

// Convert the user entered date into a format accepted by the date command.
NSDate *myDate = [textualDatePicker dateValue];
NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[dateFormatter setDateFormat:@"MMddHHmmyyyy"];
NSString *myDateString = [dateFormatter stringFromDate:myDate];

// Send date command and reboot.
NSString *command = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"/bin/date %@; reboot", myDateString];
NSTask *task = [[NSTask alloc] init];
[task setLaunchPath:@"/bin/bash"];
[task setArguments:@[ @"-c", command]];
[task launch];

}

Since we only want the app to be visible if the system time is set tot a date before 2015 we need to wrap “[self.panel setHidesOnDeactivate:NO];” in a if statement:
// 1541030400 = 01 Nov 2018 00:00:00 GMT
if ([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970] < 1541030400) {
[self.panel setHidesOnDeactivate:NO];
}
